This is based on a project I did studying Swift from the [Stanford's CS193p course, Developing Applications for iOS.](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/about-cs193p)

The cource explains the fundamentals of how to build applications for iPhone and iPad using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture pattern.

### Overview

Test your brain! Flip the cards to find a maching emoji pair.

#### Rules and gameplay
        
- The player turns over 2 cards. 
- If the pictures match, the player keeps the cards and tries again for another match. 
- If they do not match the cards are turned over again and the player to the left takes a turn.
- Player must try to remember where he has seen cards, so the player can use them to make a match.
        
#### Another options:

- The player can tap to restart the game.
- The player can shuffle the cardset
